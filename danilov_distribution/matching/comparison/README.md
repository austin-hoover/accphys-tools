# Comparison scripts

These scripts compare the envelope trajectory, without without matching, as a function of some parameters. For example, we could change the beam intensity, the lattice tunes, or the lattice coupling.

So, each script and analysis notebook is very similar. Maybe a smarter person would have made one master script and one analysis notebook with the option to choose which parameter to vary.
